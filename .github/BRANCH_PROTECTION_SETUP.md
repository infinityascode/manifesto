# 🔒 Branch Protection Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure comprehensive branch protection for the ∞aC (Absolutely Everything as Code) manifesto repository to ensure all changes go through proper review and validation.

## 🎯 Overview

The protection setup includes:
- **🚫 Direct push prevention**: No direct commits to main branch
- **✅ Required PR reviews**: All changes must be reviewed before merge
- **🔍 Status check requirements**: Automated validation must pass
- **📋 Detailed PR requirements**: Comprehensive change documentation required

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Navigate to Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/infinityascode/manifesto`
2. Click the **"Settings"** tab (you need admin access)
3. In the left sidebar, click **"Branches"**

### 2. Add Branch Protection Rule
1. Click **"Add rule"** or **"Add branch protection rule"**
2. In **"Branch name pattern"**, enter: `main`

### 3. Configure Protection Settings

#### 🔒 **Restrict pushes that create files**
- ✅ Check **"Restrict pushes that create matching branches"**

#### 📝 **Require pull request reviews before merging**
- ✅ Check **"Require a pull request before merging"**
- ✅ Check **"Require approvals"** 
- Set **"Required number of reviewers before merging"**: `1` (minimum)
- ✅ Check **"Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed"**
- ✅ Check **"Require review from code owners"** (if you have CODEOWNERS file)

#### 🤖 **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ Check **"Require status checks to pass before merging"**
- ✅ Check **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**
- Add required status checks:
  - `validate-pr` (from PR validation workflow)
  - Any other workflows you want to require

#### 🔧 **Additional Restrictions**
- ✅ Check **"Require signed commits"** (recommended for security)
- ✅ Check **"Require linear history"** (keeps clean git history)
- ✅ Check **"Include administrators"** (applies rules to all users)

#### 🗑️ **Auto-deletion**
- ✅ Check **"Allow deletions"** (for cleanup)
- ✅ Check **"Allow force pushes"** → **Everyone** (or uncheck for maximum security)

### 4. Save Protection Rule
Click **"Create"** to save your branch protection rule.

## 🔍 Validation Workflow Integration

The repository now includes automated workflows that will:

### PR Content Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)
- ✅ Validates PR titles are descriptive (10+ characters)
- ✅ Ensures comprehensive descriptions (100+ characters)  
- ✅ Checks for proper PR template usage
- ✅ Requires detailed change descriptions
- ✅ Validates testing information
- ✅ Assesses impact documentation
- ❌ **Blocks merge if validation fails**

### Automated Changelog (`changelog.yml`)
- 🔄 Automatically updates CHANGELOG.md when PRs merge
- 📝 Generates version entries based on PR content
- 🏷️ Supports manual version triggering
- 📊 Maintains proper changelog format

## 📋 PR Template Features

The comprehensive PR template ensures:
- **Structured Information**: Consistent PR formatting
- **Impact Assessment**: Clear change documentation
- **Testing Requirements**: Verification of changes
- **Changelog Integration**: Automated version tracking
- **Review Guidelines**: Clear areas for reviewer focus

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Commit Signing (Recommended)
If you enabled **"Require signed commits"**:
1. Set up GPG key signing for your commits
2. Configure git: `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`
3. All contributors must sign their commits

### Admin Enforcement
If you enabled **"Include administrators"**:
- Even repository admins must follow PR process
- No emergency bypass without proper process
- Maximum protection for production content

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Status Checks Don't Appear
1. Make sure workflows have run at least once
2. Check Actions tab for workflow execution
3. Status checks appear after first run

### If Protection Seems Too Strict
You can adjust:
- Required reviewers (reduce to 0 for lighter process)
- Status check requirements (remove specific checks)
- Administrator inclusion (uncheck for admin bypass)

### For Emergency Situations
Repository admins can:
1. Temporarily disable branch protection
2. Make emergency changes
3. Re-enable protection immediately

## 🎯 Testing the Protection

### Test Direct Push Prevention
Try to push directly to main - should fail:
```bash
git checkout main
git commit -m "test direct push"
git push origin main  # Should be rejected
```

### Test PR Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and push
3. Open PR - validation should run
4. Ensure PR template is filled out
5. Get approval and merge

## 📊 Expected Workflow

With protection enabled, the workflow becomes:

1. **Developer creates feature branch**
2. **Makes changes and pushes to branch**  
3. **Opens PR using template**
4. **🔍 Automated validation runs**
   - PR content validation
   - Status checks must pass
5. **👥 Review process**
   - Required approvals obtained
   - All discussions resolved
6. **✅ Merge approved PR**
   - 📋 Changelog automatically updated
   - Branch automatically deleted (optional)

## 🌟 Benefits

This protection setup ensures:
- **Quality Control**: All changes properly reviewed
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive change tracking
- **Automation**: Reduced manual changelog maintenance
- **Security**: Signed commits and controlled access
- **History**: Clean, linear git history
- **Collaboration**: Structured review process

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Actions tab for workflow failures
2. Review protection rule configuration
3. Ensure proper permissions and access
4. Test with a simple PR first
